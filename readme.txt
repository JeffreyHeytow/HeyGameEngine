*** AFTER THE STORM ***

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*  After the Invaders from space bombed their way through our shields   
*  and destroyed all of our defending ships, they were greeted with   
*  open arms.  As the invaders lay orbiting in the sky, the people 
*  below waved unto them to signal that it was safe to land.  No more 
*  ships were left to fire missiles at them.  This scene of friendship 
*  and love has been depicted for all to see in the HeyEngine Final Demo
